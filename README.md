Introduction
This is a basic example of a decentralized exchange (DEX) implemented in the Aleo programming language. The purpose of this DEX is to facilitate the swapping of cryptocurrencies between users. Keep in mind that this example is highly simplified and lacks many features necessary for a production-ready DEX.

Features
Token Representation: The code defines a basic structure to represent a cryptocurrency token with a balance.
User Wallets: Users are represented with a public key and a wallet containing balances of different tokens.
Initialization: Users can be initialized with an initial wallet balance.
Deposit: Users can deposit funds into their wallets.
Swap: Users can perform a basic swap operation, exchanging one token for another.
Getting Started
Install Aleo Compiler: Follow the instructions on the Aleo GitHub repository to install the Aleo compiler on your system.
Compile the Smart Contract: Use the Aleo compiler to compile the provided smart contract file. For example: aleo compile my_dex.ale
Deploy on Aleo Blockchain: Deploy the compiled smart contract on the Aleo blockchain.
Usage
Initialize users with an initial wallet balance.
Deposit funds into the user's wallet.
Perform swaps between users.
